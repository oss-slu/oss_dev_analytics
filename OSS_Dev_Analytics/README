## Welcome!

The OSS_Dev_Analytics group is focused on helping contributors better understand the health (word health was taken from CHAOSS Readme so maybe change/delete?) and efficiency of open source communities, specifically the OS with SLU community!

## What We Do

There are so many different options when it comes to repository analytics, and it can be incredibly overwhelming to join a new OS project, so here is a brief overview of the work we are (and are looking to) do(ing).

1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:  
    
    In order to get data that we are able to use for our dashboard we use a Python script that gets information from Commits, Issues, and Pull Requests of a given repository. We then have to preprocess this data into useable stats (such as time to merge) and a .json file that can be turning into actionable insights in our dashboard.
    
2. Dashboard Visualization and Insights
    
    After getting our data into a workable format we then must display the data on a webpage that is hosted via Github Pages. In this webpage we display charts based on time and volume based metrics and use this information to determine problem areas for certain repositories.
