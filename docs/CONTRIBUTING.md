Contributing to OSS Metrics Dashboard
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the OSS Metrics Dashboard! This guide will help you get started with contributing to our project.
Project Vision
We're building a simple, automated metrics dashboard for GitHub organizations that helps engineering teams track agile metrics without complex infrastructure. Our goal is to make metrics collection as easy as running a Python scriptâ€”no databases, no servers, just data.
How Can I Contribute?
Reporting Bugs
Found a bug? We want to hear about it! Before creating a bug report:

Check if the issue already exists in our issue tracker
Gather relevant information (OS, Python version, error messages)

Use our bug report template and include:

Clear description of the bug
Steps to reproduce
Expected vs. actual behavior
Your environment details
Any relevant logs or screenshots

Suggesting Features
Have an idea for a new metric or feature? Great! Create a feature request that includes:

Use case: Why would this be useful?
Proposed solution: How should it work?
Alternative approaches: Other options you considered
Impact: Who benefits from this feature?

Contributing Code
Good First Issues
New to the project? Look for issues labeled good first issue. These are:

Well-defined with clear acceptance criteria
Suitable for newcomers to the codebase
Have mentorship available from maintainers

Current Good First Issues:

Add loading spinner to dashboard
Add repository language filter
Improve error messages in config validation
Write unit tests for metrics calculations
Create troubleshooting documentation

Development Setup
Prerequisites:

Python 3.8 or higher
Git
GitHub Personal Access Token (with repo, read:org, read:user scopes)
Access to a GitHub organization for testing

Setup Steps:
bash# 1. Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/oss-metrics-dashboard.git
cd oss-metrics-dashboard

# 2. Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Set up configuration
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your GitHub token and test organization

# 5. Verify setup
python scripts/validate_config.py

# 6. Test data collection
python main.py
Common Setup Issues:

"No module named 'github'": Run pip install PyGithub
"GIT_TOKEN not found": Make sure .env file exists with GIT_TOKEN=your_token
"Organization not found": Verify you're a member of the organization

Development Workflow

Create a Branch

bash   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-123-description

Make Changes

Write clear, documented code
Follow existing code style
Add tests for new features
Update documentation as needed


Test Your Changes

bash   # Run data collection
   python main.py
   
   # Check output
   ls -la *.csv
   
   # View dashboard
   open dashboard/index.html

Commit Changes

bash   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add user filtering to dashboard"
Commit Message Format:

feat: - New feature
fix: - Bug fix
docs: - Documentation only
test: - Adding or updating tests
refactor: - Code refactoring
style: - Code style changes


Push and Create PR

bash   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.
Pull Request Guidelines
Your PR should:

Have a clear title and description
Reference related issues (e.g., "Closes #123")
Include tests for new functionality
Update relevant documentation
Pass all CI checks
Be focused on one feature/fix

Improving Documentation
Documentation improvements are always welcome! You can:

Fix typos or unclear explanations
Add examples or use cases
Improve setup instructions
Create tutorials or how-to guides
Translate documentation

Code Style Guidelines
Python

Follow PEP 8
Use descriptive variable names
Add docstrings to functions
Maximum line length: 100 characters

Example:
pythondef calculate_velocity(commits_df: pd.DataFrame, sprint_days: int = 14) -> float:
    """
    Calculate sprint velocity from commits DataFrame
    
    Args:
        commits_df: DataFrame containing commit data
        sprint_days: Length of sprint in days (default: 14)
        
    Returns:
        Velocity as commits per day
    """
    total_commits = len(commits_df)
    return total_commits / sprint_days
JavaScript

Use ES6+ features
Consistent indentation (2 spaces)
Descriptive variable names
Add comments for complex logic

Testing Guidelines
We use pytest for testing. Tests go in the tests/ directory.
Running Tests:
bash# All tests
pytest

# Specific test file
pytest tests/test_metrics.py

# With coverage report
pytest --cov=scripts --cov-report=html
Writing Tests:
pythondef test_calculate_velocity():
    """Test velocity calculation with sample data"""
    sample_data = pd.DataFrame({
        'sha': ['abc123', 'def456'],
        'date': ['2025-01-01', '2025-01-02']
    })
    
    velocity = calculate_velocity(sample_data, sprint_days=2)
    assert velocity == 1.0  # 2 commits / 2 days = 1/day
