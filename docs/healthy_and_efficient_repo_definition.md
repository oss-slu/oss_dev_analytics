## Defining a Healthy anf Efficient Repository

### Purpose
Before trying to improve the health or efficiency of repositories in our organization, we first need to agree on what those terms actually mean. This document is meant to explore how the open-source community and professional developers generally think about "healthy"  and "efficient" repositories, and then use that understanding to come up with a working definition for our organization. This is only an initial draft and is meant to start a discussion, not to be a final decision.

### What Do Healthy Repositories Have?
From looking at common open-source practices and developer discussions, healthy repositories usually show signs that they are active and being maintained. Some common characterisitics include:
- Ongoing activityy such as commits, issues, and pull requests
- Issues and pull requests receiving responses in a reasonable amount of time 
- Clear documentation that explains how contributos can get involved
- A manageable number of open issues and pull requests
- Signs that maintainer are actively monitoring and supporting the project

In general, a healthy repository feels like a project that is alive and supported rather than abandoned

---

### What Do Efficient Repositories Have?
Efficiency focuses more on how smoothly work moves through the repository. Efficient repositories tend to have:
- Clear processes for creating issues and submitting pull requests
- Predictable review and merge workflows
- Less confusion or rework due to unclear requirements
- Some level of automation to reduce repetitive manual work

An efficient repository helps contributors and maintainers spend less time on overhead and more time on actual development

---

### Are Healthy and Efficient Repositories the Same?
Although health and efficiency are closely related, they are not exactly the same thing. A repository can be efficient but not healthy if work moves quickly but there is little community engagement or poor documentation. On the other hand, a repository can be healthy but not very efficient if it has active contributors but long review or merge times.
Because of this, both health and efficiency should be considered together when evaluating repositories.

---

### Proposed Working Definition for Our Organization
For the purpose of this project, a practical working definition is:
> A healthy and efficient repository is one that remains active over time, supports collaboration, and allows issues and pull requests to move through the development process with clear expectations and minimal friction.
This definition is flexible enough to apply across different repositories while still giving us a shared understanding of what we are trying to measure and improve.

---

### Relation to Current Metrics
The metrics currently shown in the dashboard, such as the number of issues, pull requests, commits, and average times to merge or close issues, can be used as indicators of repository health and efficiency. These metrics should be treated as signals rather than strict judgments, since context can vary between repositories.

### Scope and Limitations
This document does not define exact threshols for what makes a repository "good" or "bad." It also does not attempt to compare repositories of different sizes or maturity levels. These details can be discussed and refined later as the project continues.
