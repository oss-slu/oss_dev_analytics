Removed `wave` from requirements.txt because it caused installation errors.

Error encountered earlier during PR merge:
  ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement wave
  ERROR: No matching distribution found for wave

Reason:
- `wave` is a built-in Python standard library module, not a package on PyPI.
- Adding it to requirements.txt makes `pip install -r requirements.txt` fail.

Impact:
- Removing it fixes dependency installation in GitHub Actions.
- Application still works as expected, since `wave` can be imported directly without installing.",,23.785714285714285,fe23711f354270bde647c1acd76c2f041e2474f4,,,2025-09-22 16:27:42+00:00,,,,,,,,
